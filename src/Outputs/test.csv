4,The contract herein included differs substantially from traditional contracts for civil works. The basic,14,104,7.428571428571429
4,"difference is that under the Output- and Performance-based Road Contract, most of the payments to",15,97,6.466666666666667
4,be made to the contractor are not based on quantities of works measured by unit prices for works,18,96,5.333333333333333
4,"inputs, but on measured “outputs” reflecting the target conditions of the roads under contract (in other",16,104,6.5
4,"words: “what the roads are supposed to look like”), expressed through  “Service Levels.”  These",14,95,6.785714285714286
4,Service Levels are defined in the contract.  Another major difference is that the Contractor is fully,16,101,6.3125
4,"responsible for the design of the works which are necessary to reach the required Service Levels, and",17,101,5.9411764705882355

4,"An important focus of the contract is on  Management and Maintenance Services , including",14,89,6.357142857142857
4,physical works on the Roads under contract which are needed to maintain the agreed Service Levels,16,97,6.0625
4,"over time, but also all activities related to the management and evaluation of the road network under",17,101,5.9411764705882355

6,bringing the road to a certain service level and then maintaining it at that level for a relatively,18,99,5.5

6,Improvement Works which have been explicitly specified by the Employer in the contract are,14,90,6.428571428571429
6,quoted on the basis of measurable output quantities and paid as performed. In order to be entitled,17,98,5.764705882352941
6,"to the monthly payment for maintenance services, the Contractor must ensure that the roads",14,90,6.428571428571429
6,under contract comply with the Service Levels which have been specified in the bidding,14,86,6.142857142857143

6,"Under the OPRC, the Contractor has a strong financial incentive to be both efficient and",15,88,5.866666666666666

8,instructions from the Employer concerning the type and volume of road maintenance works to be,15,93,6.2
8,"carried out. Instead, all initiative rests with the Contractor who must do whatever is necessary",15,96,6.4
8,and efficient to achieve the quality levels required. This concept is expected to lead not only to,17,98,5.764705882352941
8,"significant efficiency gains, as mentioned earlier, but also to technological innovation.",11,89,8.090909090909092

8,"make for the use of the infrastructure (tolls, tariffs, user fees, taxes, etc.). The Road",15,89,5.933333333333334
8,Administrations should benefit by obtaining better overall road conditions at the same levels of,14,96,6.857142857142857
8,"expenditure. For contractors and other private sector enterprises, the new type of contracts should",14,99,7.071428571428571
8,"open up new business opportunities, in which longer contract periods provide a more stable",14,90,6.428571428571429
8,"business environment, and for the establishment of true Public-Private Partnership relations.",11,93,8.454545454545455
8,"However, it may be the future generations who will perhaps benefit most, since they will not",16,92,5.75
8,have to pay for the reconstruction of roads destroyed because of a lack of maintenance today.,16,93,5.8125
8,14.,1,3,3.0
8,Although the design of the works and services to be carried out is under the responsibility,16,91,5.6875
8,"of the Contractor, this type of procurement requires good preparatory engineering work. It is",14,93,6.642857142857143
8,necessary to prepare comprehensive information on the actual condition of the roads covered by,14,94,6.714285714285714
8,"the contract. If rehabilitation works are required, the Employer should define the level of quality",15,99,6.6
8,(or standard) to be achieved by the Contractor for delivery and completion during the contract. If,16,98,6.125
8,"improvement works are sought, a well-designed bill of quantities defining specific outputs for",13,94,7.230769230769231
8,"bidders to price and, later on, allow measurement and payment of the Contractor, is of paramount",16,96,6.0
8,"importance. Emergency works, although impossible to quantify in advance, will certainly be",12,90,7.5
8,"necessary. To allow bidders to offer prices for Emergency Works, a unit price bill of quantities",16,96,6.0
8,(similar for civil works under unit prices) with quantity estimates should be prepared for bidders,15,98,6.533333333333333
8,"to price for bid evaluation purposes. Later on, these unit prices and real measured volumes of",16,94,5.875
8,Emergency Works executed will be used for payments. Another important area requiring sound,13,90,6.923076923076923
8,engineering advice is to define if the Rehabilitation Works should be included in the contract or,16,97,6.0625
8,be carried out in advance under a separate “standard” civil works contract. This decision depends,15,97,6.466666666666667
8,in each case on the risks that the Borrower (and his advisor) understands as possible to be,17,91,5.352941176470588
8,"administered cost-effectively by the Contractor. In general, if those initial works represent more",13,98,7.538461538461538
8,"than 40-50% of the contract value, the risks may be too high and an initial separate contract may",18,97,5.388888888888889
9,ix,1,2,2.0
9,"be warranted. However, if the Employer wants to have Rehabilitation Works based on a pre-",15,89,5.933333333333334
9,"defined design and use this document to connect it to future maintenance by the same Contractor,",16,96,6.0
9,"the documents need to be adapted. In this case, the bill of quantities for Rehabilitation Works",16,95,5.9375
9,should be modified to become similar to those for emergency works and the measurement and,15,89,5.933333333333334
9,payment clauses should be modified for an “input” type contract.,10,64,6.4
9,15.,1,3,3.0
9,When Rehabilitation Works and Improvement Works are not specifically required in the,12,84,7.0
9,"bidding documents, it is expected that in order to comply with the contract, the Contractor will",16,96,6.0
9,"most likely have to carry out different types of works, including some small initial rehabilitation",15,99,6.6
9,"and improvements, routine maintenance activities and periodic maintenance works. The",10,84,8.4
9,"definition of the exact nature of the works, their timing, their costing and their implementation is",16,100,6.25
9,left to the judgment of the Contractor. This means that his capacity must be above the usual,17,92,5.411764705882353
9,"capacity of a traditional civil works contractor. In fact, an essential attribute is the capacity to",16,100,6.25
9,"manage roads, while the actual physical execution may either be carried out by the Contractor",15,93,6.2
9,"himself, or by different specialized firms participating in a Joint Venture with the main",14,89,6.357142857142857
9,"contractor, or under subcontracts. Joint Ventures may include Engineering firms and medium,",12,91,7.583333333333333
9,"small and even micro-enterprises. Consequently, a well-designed prequalification process is",10,91,9.1
9,highly recommended in order to ensure that only qualified bidders participate in the bidding,14,92,6.571428571428571
9,"process, even though, the present bidding document can also be used when post-qualification is",14,94,6.714285714285714
9,envisaged. In the design of the prequalification requirements the borrower should consider if the,14,97,6.928571428571429
9,experience of specialist sub-contractors (like an engineering consultant) should be allowed to be,13,97,7.461538461538462

270,be taken into consideration:,4,28,7.0
270,Roughness,1,9,9.0
270,A range of devices are available to measure the ride quality of a road as indicated by the roughness,19,100,5.2631578947368425
270,"statistic.  While variations exist, these different devices can broadly be categorised into one of the",15,102,6.8
270,following two types:,3,20,6.666666666666667
270,•,1,1,1.0
270,Response type meters,3,20,6.666666666666667
270,Profilometers,1,13,13.0
270,The former of the two yields an estimate of the road roughness directly from the movement of the,18,96,5.333333333333333
270,vehicle along the road. These need to be calibrated against a reference roughness. Examples of this,16,99,6.1875
270,approach include the Bump Integrator.,5,37,7.4
270,The second grouping of devices record the elevation profile of the road surface and this is used to,18,99,5.5
270,"establish the roughness.  Within this class of devices are simple hand pushed devices, through to",15,97,6.466666666666667
270,vehicle mounted systems.,3,24,8.0
270,"For flexibility in the use of the data, outputs should be expressed both in International Roughness",16,99,6.1875
270,"Index (IRI in m/km) plus any local variations in use (NAASRA counts, Bump Index etc).",15,85,5.666666666666667
270,The reporting interval for the roughness data should be such that it is both sufficiently long to include,18,105,5.833333333333333
270,"all the wavelengths of road profile that make up roughness, but also sufficiently short that the",16,96,6.0
